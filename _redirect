#/admin/*  /admin/:splat  200!  Role=admin

# The rule above tells Netlify’s CDN to grant access to 
# the `/admin` path, and everything under it, only to visitors
# whose JWT tokens include the `admin` role in their `app_metadata`. 
# Any other visitor that tries to access those URLs will be 
# presented with a 404 page.

# If you don’t want to present a 404 page, you can set a fallback rule
# to redirect unauthorized users to a specific page, like a login page. 
# The next example adds a new rule to accomplish that:

/admin/*  /admin/:splat  200!  Role=administrator,editor,volunteer,leader
/admin/*  /login  401!  Role=administrator

# The second rule in the example is what we call a fallback rule. 
# It tells Netlify’s CDN that it must redirect every visitor that’s 
# not in the `admin` role to the `/login` page.

# You can also grant several roles access to the same path 
# by chaining them with commas:

#/private/* /private/:splat  200!  Role=editor,admin
